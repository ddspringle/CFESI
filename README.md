# CFESI
An ESI API wrapper for Eve Online written in CFML

Current version: alpha-0.0.1

The EVEESIService CFC contains an API interface to the [Eve Online ESI API](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/) - latest build: 2017-06-10

This code **does not** contain any Oauth interface (yet) nor does it do any error handling, this is left to the implementation of the API and not handled directly within the API itself.

This code has been preliminarily tested and appears to be working, however this is an alpha release and bugs should be anticipated. Please report any bugs here in the issues section of the site.
